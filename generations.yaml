    description: "The Lexus RX 350 was introduced in 2006 as a mid-cycle enhancement to the second-generation RX (XU30), replacing the RX 330 with a larger, more powerful 3.5-liter 2GR-FE V6 engine producing 270 horsepower and 251 lb-ft of torque. Paired with a five-speed automatic transmission and available in both front-wheel drive and all-wheel drive configurations, it delivered improved acceleration and overall performance compared to its predecessor. The exterior styling remained largely unchanged from the RX 330, featuring a sleek, car-like design with SUV proportions. The interior continued to offer luxury appointments including available leather seating, premium audio systems, and wood trim. Available technology included a voice-activated navigation system, rear-seat DVD entertainment, and an adaptive front lighting system. Safety features expanded with the Vehicle Stability Control system, traction control, and available adaptive cruise control. Production ended in December 2008, though some 2009 model year vehicles remained available into early 2009."

    description: "The fourth-generation RX 350 (part of the fifth-generation RX lineup) represents a significant departure from previous models, built on Lexus's new TNGA GA-K platform offering improved structural rigidity, reduced weight, and enhanced driving dynamics. Notably, the powertrain shifts from the long-standing 3.5-liter V6 to a new 2.4-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 275 horsepower and 317 lb-ft of torque—offering less horsepower but significantly more torque than its predecessor—paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission. Available in front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive configurations, it delivers improved fuel efficiency while maintaining strong performance. The exterior evolves Lexus's design language with a sleeker interpretation of the spindle grille (now called 'spindle body'), sharper body lines, and a connected taillight design. The interior features Lexus's new cockpit design philosophy centered around a standard 9.8-inch or available 14-inch touchscreen with the new Lexus Interface system, featuring wireless Apple CarPlay/Android Auto, cloud-based navigation, and voice assistant functionality with natural language processing. Advanced technology includes digital key capability, a panoramic view monitor, and traffic jam assist.

Available in both standard and F Sport configurations, with the latter offering distinctive styling elements, adaptive variable suspension, and performance dampers. The newest RX 350 balances the model's traditional strengths in comfort and refinement with improved driving dynamics and thoroughly modern technology."
